# Prompt History Record: Phase 2 Integration Tasks

## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created the tasks.md file for Phase II: Full-Stack Todo Application Integration, Verification & Readiness. The tasks are organized by phase following the user story priorities from the specification. The implementation strategy follows an incremental delivery approach, starting with foundational setup and configuration validation, then moving to core integration, and finally completing with user stories in priority order (P1, P2, etc.). Each phase has independent test criteria and acceptance scenarios mapped from the specification.

## OUTCOME

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks for the integration, verification, and readiness phase of the full-stack todo application.

## EVALUATION

The tasks are well-structured according to the checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. They align with the user stories from the specification and follow the implementation approach outlined in the plan.

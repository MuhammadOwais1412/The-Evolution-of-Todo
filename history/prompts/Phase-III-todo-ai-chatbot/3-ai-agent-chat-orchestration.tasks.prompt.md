# AI Agent & Chat Orchestration Tasks Generated

## Summary

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Phase III – Part B: AI Agent & Chat Orchestration. The tasks are organized into 12 phases with specific user story mappings, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities.

## Prompt Text

```

```

## Response Text

Generated 65 specific, actionable tasks organized across 12 phases for implementing the AI Agent & Chat Orchestration:

- Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies (5 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational Components (5 tasks)
- Phase 3: [US1] Core AI Agent Service (6 tasks)
- Phase 4: [US2] Context Reconstruction (5 tasks)
- Phase 5: [US3] MCP Tool Orchestration (5 tasks)
- Phase 6: [US4] Audit Logging (5 tasks)
- Phase 7: [US5] API Endpoint Implementation (6 tasks)
- Phase 8: [US6] User Confirmation Flows (5 tasks)
- Phase 9: [US7] Error Handling & User Experience (5 tasks)
- Phase 10: [US8] Additional Endpoints & Monitoring (5 tasks)
- Phase 11: Testing & Validation (7 tasks)
- Phase 12: Security & Optimization (5 tasks)

Each task follows the required format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
Tasks are organized by user stories to enable independent implementation and testing.
Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified.
Implementation strategy includes MVP scope and incremental delivery approach.

## Outcome & Impact

- Complete task breakdown created for implementing AI agent functionality
- Tasks mapped to specific user stories for independent testing
- Dependencies clearly identified between phases
- Parallel execution opportunities highlighted for efficient development
- MVP scope defined for early deliverable
- Ready for implementation using /sp.implement

## Files Summary

- Tasks document: specs/Phase-III-todo-ai-chatbot/Part-B-ai-agent-chat-orchestration/tasks.md
- PHR record: history/prompts/Phase-III-todo-ai-chatbot/3-ai-agent-chat-orchestration.tasks.prompt.md

## Next Steps

Ready for implementation using /sp.implement to execute the tasks in sequence.

## Reflection Note

Tasks successfully organized by user stories with proper dependencies and parallelization opportunities identified.

## Evaluation

The tasks document provides a comprehensive, actionable roadmap for implementing the AI Agent & Chat Orchestration with clear organization by user stories, proper dependencies, and adherence to the required format.
